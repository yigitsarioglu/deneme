# Java OOP Student Projects
Java Object oriented programming (OOP) Projects

## Project 1 - Nature Simulator

It is a student project which is developed using object-oriented programming with java.

In summary, implemented two types of creatures: Plants will grow and reproduce, while herbivores will move around to eat them and will also re-produce when they accumulate enough health. The game will not be played by a human, but will rather play itself.

## Project 2 - Snakes

For this project,  implement a game called Snakes! It is a game like the classic game Snake with some important differences and enhancements.The game will not be played by a human, but will rather play itself. 

## Project 3 - Merkle Tree

In addition to its applications in the cryptography, file revision systems and most recently,
the cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Merkle Tree is a powerful
mechanism that has been widely used in peer-to-peer file sharing, such as torrent protocol.
For this project, you are expected to implement one of the most basic approaches to
peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing technology.
