# Simple nature simulation/game composed of pixel-like creatures interacting with each other.

It is a student project which is developed using object-oriented programming with java.

In summary, implemented two types of creatures:
Plants will grow and reproduce, while herbivores will move around to eat them and will also re-produce when they accumulate enough health. 
The game will not be played by a human, but will rather play itself.
