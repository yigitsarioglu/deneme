# Simple Snake Game withe simple AI

It is a student project which is developed using object-oriented programming with java.
- A snake should be able to locate the food, turn and move to it intelligently. This is where you need to code a simple AI. You can assume that all snakes know where
the food is exactly.
- A snake will consume food and grow like the classic game Snake. After a food is consumed, you need to immediately spawn a new
food in a random empty position. A food is drawn as a small yellow square.
 - A snake cannot move over its own body or over another snake. Moreover, a snake cannot go beyond the world boundaries.
- If a snake reaches size 8, it will divide (reproduce) into two snakes of size 4. The newly born snake’s head will be the old snake’s tail.
