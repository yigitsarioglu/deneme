# Merkle Tree
Student project , which handles downloading the files with checking their correctness(hash values) ,uses data structures like merkle trees.

In addition to its applications in the cryptography, file revision systems and most recently,
the cryptocurrency technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Merkle Tree is a powerful
mechanism that has been widely used in peer-to-peer file sharing, such as torrent protocol.
For this project, you are expected to implement one of the most basic approaches to
peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing technology.


According to Wikipedia, p2p file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media
using peer-to-peer networking technology. By using a p2p software, the users are able to
share or get access to the content they desire. In this project, we limit our interest to the
“downloading” part of the p2p file sharing
